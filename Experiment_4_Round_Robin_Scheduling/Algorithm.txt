Algorithm:
1. Used for time sharing systems
2. Pre-emption is added which enables system to switch between processes.
3. A fixed time is allotted to each process, called quantum, for execution.
4. A process is executed for the given time period that process us pre-empted and another
process executes for the given time period.
5. Context switching is used to save states of pre-empted processes.
6. Enter total number of processes, enter their arrival time and burst time.
7. Enter the time quantum for each process.
8. Print the burst time, waiting time for each process.
9. Calculate and print the total waiting time and total turnaround time.
