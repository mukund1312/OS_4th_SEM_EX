Algorithm:


1. Use fork() function to create one child and one parent process
2. For child process , fork() returns 0
3. So we calculate sum of all odd numbers
4. Fork() returns value greater than 0 for parent process
5. So we calculate sum of even numbers
6. We do so by just checking the value returned by fork() command
