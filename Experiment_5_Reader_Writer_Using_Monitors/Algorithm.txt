Algorithm:

1. Any number of readers can read from the shared resource simultaneously, but only one
writer can write to the shared resource at a time.
2. A writer cannot write to the resource if there are any readers accessing the resource at that
time
3. Similarly, a reader cannot read if there is a writer accessing the resource or if there are any
waiting writers
4. Mutexes (pthread_mutex_t) â€“ Mutual exclusion lock: Block access to variables by other
threads. This enforces exclusive access by a thread to a variable or set of variables.
5. Condition Variables (pthread_cond_t): The condition variable mechanism allows threads to
suspend execution and relinquish the processor until some condition is true.
6. The status of reader and writer is printed
