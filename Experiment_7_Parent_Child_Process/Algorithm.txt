Algorithm â€“

1. Start the program.
2. Declare the pid .
3. Initiate the fork process and store it on pid .
4. Check If pid is 0 then write a statement to get child process id using getpid().
5. Check if pid is greater than zero print parent id using ppid() function .
6. Use wait() to wait for the child process to finish .
7. Then the child process finished .
8. Check if pid<0 then failure in creating a child process .
9. Stop the program.
