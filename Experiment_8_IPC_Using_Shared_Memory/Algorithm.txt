Algorithm Writer Code:

1. Initiate a variable key_t and store ftok and its path where to store .
2. Using shmget , store the generated id in shmid .
3. Using str take input .
4. Write the string in str .
5. End the Program.

Algorithm For Reader Code:

1. Get the key of shared memory using ftok command.
2. Store the shmid that you get from shmget command using the key .
3. Get the string that was previously written in memory .
4. Use the shmdt command to pan the shmid .
5. Exit the program.
